# Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Learning Repository**! This is a personal collection of code, scripts, and examples I've created while exploring various topics in programming and artificial intelligence. Each folder focuses on a specific topic, including a brief explanation, the main code, and, in some cases, practical examples to demonstrate its use.

## Structure

The repository is organized into topic-specific folders. Each folder contains:
- **Main Code**: The core implementation of the topic.
- **Example Usage**: A script or notebook showing how to use the code.
- **Detailed Explanation**: A `README.md` file describing the purpose, usage, and any relevant information about the topic.

## Included topics

1. [Mixture Density Network](mixture_density_network/README.md): MDN python implementation

### Disclaimer

The majority of the code in this repository has been generated with the assistance of **ChatGPT**, an AI language model by OpenAI. While I use this repository to enhance my learning and understanding, the generated code has been adapted, tested, and sometimes modified to suit my specific needs.
